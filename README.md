# MNIST-GAN

mnist-gan is a simple GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) that learns how to generate images that look like mnist digits. Separate networks are trained for each digit. The idea is to train a "generator" network which when fed noise  will generate an image that looks like an mnist style.
